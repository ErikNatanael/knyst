# Knyst

Knyst is a real time audio synthesis framework focusing on flexibility and performance. It's main target use case is desktop multi-threaded environments, but it can also do single threaded and/or non real time synthesis. Embedded platforms are currently not supported, but on the roadmap.

## The name

"Knyst" is a Swedish word meaning _very faint sound_. It is normally almost exclusively used in the negative e.g. "Det h√∂rs inte ett knyst" (eng. "You cannot hear a sound"), but I think it's well worth some affirmative use.

# Features

- good runtime performance
- interopability with static Rust DSP libraries e.g. dasp and fundsp (they can be encapsulated in a node and added to the graph)
- real time changes to the audio graph
- sample accurate parameter changes
- graphs can be nodes and changes can be applied to graphs within graphs at any depth
- feedback connections to get a 1 block delayed output of a node
- any number of inputs/outputs from a node
- choose your level of flexibility and optimisation: create a graph with lots of interconnected nodes or hard code it all into one node when you need more performance

# Safety

Knyst uses a little bit of unsafe under the hood to improve performance in the most sensitive parts of the library, as do some of its dependencies. The user, however, never _needs_ to write any unsafe code.

# Roadmap

Vision for the future

- sample accurate node addition to the graph
- sample accurate connection change to the graph
- automatic parameter change interpolation
- automatic GUI generation from the graph incl. interactively changing connections and parameters
- parallel processing of large graphs
- automatic sample rate conversion
- allowing graphs with differenc block sizes using automatic buffering
- support no_std for embedded platforms
