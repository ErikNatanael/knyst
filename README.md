# Knyst

Knyst is a real time audio synthesis framework focusing on flexibility and performance. It's main target use case is desktop multi-threaded environments, but it can also do single threaded and/or non real time synthesis. Embedded platforms are currently not supported, but on the roadmap.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Knyst is not stable. Knyst's API is still developing and can vary wildly between releases.


# Examples

## Play a sine wave

```rust
// Set up knyst
let mut backend = CpalBackend::new(CpalBackendOptions::default())?;
let _sphere = KnystSphere::start(
    &mut backend,
    SphereSettings {
        num_inputs: 1,
        num_outputs: 2,
        ..Default::default()
    },
    print_error_handler,
);
// Add a sine wave to the top level graph
let sine_osc_handle = oscillator(WavetableId::cos()).freq(200.);
// Output it to the graph output, which for the top level graph is the
// application output.
graph_output(0, sine_osc_handle);
```

## Implement your own `Gen`

Using the `impl_gen` macro takes care of most of the boiler plate. However, if you need a variable number of inputs or outputs
you have to implement the `Gen` trait yourself.

```rust 
struct DummyGen {
    counter: Sample,
}
#[impl_gen]
impl DummyGen {
    // Having a `new` method enabled generation of a function `dummy_gen() -> Handle<DummyGenHandle>`
    pub fn new() -> Self {
      Self {
        counter: 0.,
      }
    }

    /// The process method, or any method with the `#[process]` attribute is what will be run every block
    /// when processing audio. It must not allocate or wait (unless you are doing non-realtime stuff).
    /// 
    /// Inputs are extracted from any argument with the type &[Sample]
    /// Outputs are extracted from any argument with the type &mut [Sample]
    /// 
    /// Additionally, &[Trig] is an input channel of triggers and enables the `inputname_trig()` method on the handle
    /// to conveniently schedule a trigger. `SampleRate` gives you the current sample rate and `BlockSize` gives you
    /// the block size.
    #[process]
    fn process(&mut self, counter: &[Sample], output: &mut [Sample]) -> GenState {
        for (count, out) in counter.iter().zip(output.iter_mut()) {
            self.counter += 1.;
            *out = count + self.counter;
        }
        GenState::Continue
    }
    /// The init method will be called before adding the `Gen` to a running graph. Here is where you can
    /// allocate buffers and initialise state based on sample rate and block size.
    fn init(&mut self, _sample_rate: SampleRate, _block_size: BlockSize, _node_id: NodeId) {
      self.counter = 0.;
    }
}
```

# Features

- good runtime performance
- real time changes to the audio graph via an async compatible interface
- sample accurate node and parameter change scheduling to the graph
- interopability with static Rust DSP libraries e.g. dasp and fundsp (they can be encapsulated in a node and added to the graph)
- graphs can be nodes and changes can be applied to graphs within graphs at any depth
- feedback connections to get a 1 block delayed output of a node to an earlier node in the chain
- any number of inputs/outputs from a node
- allows inner graphs with different block sizes using automatic buffering where necessary
- choose your level of flexibility and optimisation: create a graph with lots of interconnected nodes or hard code it all into one node when you need more performance

# Safety

Knyst uses a little bit of unsafe under the hood to improve performance in the most sensitive parts of the library, as do some of its dependencies. The user, however, never _needs_ to write any unsafe code.

## The name

"Knyst" is a Swedish word meaning _very faint sound_. It is normally almost exclusively used in the negative e.g. "Det h√∂rs inte ett knyst" (eng. "You cannot hear a sound"), but I think it's well worth some affirmative use.

# Roadmap

Vision for the future

- automatic parameter change interpolation
- automatic GUI generation from the graph incl. interactively changing connections and parameters
- tools for musical time scheduling incl phrasing options e.g. rubato, accel./rit. and asymmetric time signatures
- parallel processing of large graphs
- automatic sample rate conversion
- support no_std for embedded platforms
