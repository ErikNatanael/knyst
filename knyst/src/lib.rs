//! # Knyst - audio graph and synthesis library
//!
//! Knyst is a real time audio synthesis framework focusing on flexibility and
//! performance. It's main target use case is desktop multi-threaded real time
//! environments, but it can also do single threaded and/or non real time
//! synthesis. Embedded platforms are currently not supported, but on the
//! roadmap.
//!
//! The main selling point of Knyst is that the graph can be modified while it's
//! running: nodes and connections between nodes can be added/removed. It also
//! supports shared resources such as wavetables and buffers.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Knyst is in its early stages. Expect large breaking API changes between
//! versions.
//!
//! ## The name
//!
//! "Knyst" is a Swedish word meaning _very faint sound_.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The core of Knyst is the [`Graph`] struct and the [`Gen`] trait. [`Graph`]s
//! can have nodes containing anything that implements [`Gen`]. [`Graph`]s
//! can also themselves be added as a node.
//!
//! Nodes in a running [`Graph`] can be freed or signal to the [`Graph`]
//! that they or the entire [`Graph`] should be freed. [`Connection`]s between
//! Nodes and the inputs and outputs of a [`Graph`] can also be changed
//! while the [`Graph`] is running. This way, Knyst acheives a similar
//! flexibility to SuperCollider.
//!
//! It is easy to get things wrong when using a [`Graph`] as a [`Gen`] directly
//! so that functionality is encapsulated. For the highest level [`Graph`] of
//! your program you may want to use [`RunGraph`] to get a node which
//! you can run in a real time thread or non real time to generate samples.
//! Using the [`audio_backend`]s this process is automated for you.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - *unstable*: Enables unstable optimisations in some cases that currently requires nightly.
//! - *debug-warn-on-alloc*: Print a warning instead of panicing when allocating on the audio thread (debug build only).
//! - *serde-derive*: Enables some data structures to be serialized/deserialized using serde.
//! - *cpal*: Enables the cpal AudioBackend
//! - *jack*: Enables the JACK AudioBackend
